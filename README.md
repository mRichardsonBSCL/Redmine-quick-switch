Biton Redmine Viewer (Quick Opener)

⚠️This is very tempermental and was only made for my own use case without much care for code quality or general use⚠️
## Features

- Allows faster navigation to Redmine pages for specific issues allowing a keyboard-only approach 

## Install

Requires Chrome browser to use. If the extension was somehow published install from the below:
[**Chrome** extension]()

## Local Install

Clone the repo and in the root directory (the one containing `node_modules`) run `npm i` to install the required dependencies

`npm run watch` can be used to hot reload any changes to the extension (once installed on Chrome's extensions page) and is useful for testing

`npm run build` bundles the project into a build folder which can be added as a custom extension by clicking "Load unpacked extension" on the developer tab.

"quickstart.md" better explains the above commands 

## Contribution

Suggestions and pull requests are welcomed!.
